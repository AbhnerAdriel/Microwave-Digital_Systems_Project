    This system contains many of the building blocks that make up all digital systems and demonstrates how they can be combined to control one of the most life-changing               inventions of all time.

     Microwave ovens simply use a radio frequency (rf) generator with enough power to excite the molecules in food and heat it up. The four basic components used in these              appliances have not changed much since microwave  cooking was invented in the 1960s: a high-voltage transformer, a diode, a capacitor, and a magnetron tube. The only              important thing that you need to know about this circuit  is  that  when  you  apply  120  VAC  to  the  transformer,  the  oven  cooks your food and when you disconnect the      120 VAC, the oven turns off. In other words, it can be controlled by a 1 or a 0. The circuits that control the micro-wave  oven  have  changed  over  the  years,  from            simple mechanical  timers  to sophisticated  digital  systems.

    The  controller  which  will  design  allows  the  user to enter the desired cook time in minutes and seconds and offers the normal basic user controls for a typical oven         similar to the picture in figure above.
